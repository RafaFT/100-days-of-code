The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 13, Monday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 - 2019/05/13
Started writing unittests for the _FinancialIndicesApi_ class, and finished the tests for the _create_api_url() method. 

### R1D2 - 2019/05/14
Kept working on the same unittest script. Finished the tests for the method _get_json_results.

### R1D3 - 2019/05/15
Kept working on the script 'test_bcb_api.py', which is a unittest based file for the class FinancialIndicesApi.

### R1D4 - 2019/05/17
Kept working on 'test_bcb_api.py' and made some adjustments to the original bcb_api.py file.

### R1D5 - 2019/05/18
Almost finishing the unittest file for the FinancialIndicesApi class, two methods left.

### R1D6 - 2019/05/19
Kept working on my unittest file for the FinancialIndicesApi. I'm struggling a lot on design decisions.

### R1D7 - 2019/05/21
Still working on my tests for the FinancialIndicesApi class. Made a lot of changes to the behaviour of the _create_api_url() method.
I'm also re-thinking about the design decisions made for the _remove_wrong_records() method.

### R1D8 - 2019/05/22
Worked mostly on changes to the bcb_api script, to make it pass the new unittests. 

### R1D9 - 2019/05/23
Technically finished the unittest classes for the bcb_api script.

### R1D10 - 2019/05/25
Decided to chill a little bit (tired of tests) and just did a couple of codewars and hackerrank exercises.

### R1D11 - 2019/05/26
Just did a few exercises from both hackerrank and codewars.

### R1D12 - 2019/05/27
Today I did a lot. Did a couple of codewars exercises, finished updating the bcb_api.py, to make the class
FinancialIndicesApi pass all unittests. Started making the unittest script for the IndicesExpander class.

### R1D13
