# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Rafael

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 13, Monday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 - 2019/05/13
Started writing unittests for the _FinancialIndicesApi_ class, and finished the tests for the _create_api_url() method. 

### R1D2 - 2019/05/14
Kept working on the same unittest script. Finished the tests for the method _get_json_results.

### R1D3 - 2019/05/15
Kept working on the script 'test_bcb_api.py', which is a unittest based file for the class FinancialIndicesApi.

### R1D4 - 2019/05/17
Kept working on 'test_bcb_api.py' and made some adjustments to the original bcb_api.py file.

### R1D5 - 2019/05/18
Almost finishing the unittest file for the FinancialIndicesApi class, two methods left.

### R1D6 - 2019/05/19
Kept working on my unittest file for the FinancialIndicesApi. I'm struggling a lot on design decisions.

### R1D7 - 2019/05/21
Still working on my tests for the FinancialIndicesApi class. Made a lot of changes to the behaviour of the _create_api_url() method.
I'm also re-thinking about the design decisions made for the _remove_wrong_records() method.

### R1D8 - 2019/05/22
Worked mostly on changes to the bcb_api script, to make it pass the new unittests. 

### R1D9 - 2019/05/23
Technically finished the unittest classes for the bcb_api script.

### R1D10 - 2019/05/25
Decided to chill a little bit (tired of tests) and just did a couple of codewars and hackerrank exercises.

### R1D11 - 2019/05/26
Just did a few exercises from both hackerrank and codewars.

### R1D12 - 2019/05/27
Today I did a lot. Did a couple of codewars exercises, finished updating the bcb_api.py, to make the class
FinancialIndicesApi pass all unittests. Started making the unittest script for the IndicesExpander class.

### R1D13 - 2019/05/28
Did a couple of [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/rafael_ftrad) exercises and started making unittest script for
the IndicesExpander class. Basically finished tests for the field _workdays and private method _daily_workdays_indices_expander().

### R1D14 - 2019/05/29
* Did one codewars exercise.
* Wrote a few more test cases for the class TestDailyWorkdayIndicesExpander.
* Created and wrote tests for the TestDailyThreeFieldIndicesExpander class.

### R1D15 - 2019/05/30
* Added support from year 2001 to 2011 to the workdays.csv file from [financial_indices project](https://github.com/RafaFT/financial_indices).
* New file means broken classes and tests. Also updated the unittest test cases there were broken by the extra workdays.

### R1D16 - 2019/06/03
* Studied logging a lot, both for work and personal project.
* Today I did a somewhat model class of a QTreewidget with PyQy, and is just occured me that it might be fun to create and share some PyQy recipes.
* Did a few more tests for the financial indices project, and started coding the IndicesExpander class.
